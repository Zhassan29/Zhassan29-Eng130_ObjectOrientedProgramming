# method - function -
# declare a function called
# 1 - def user_name():
#     2- def user_name
#     3 def user_name()
#     4 def void user_name()
#     5 user_name()
#     - takes user name
# - displays welcome user name back to user in same line

# control flow
# if elif else

# - how to iterate through a list of 5 items

# food = ["choc", "crisp", "sweets", "drinks"]
# for x in food:
#     print(x)
# i = 0
# while i < len(food):
#     print(food[i])
#     i = i + 1



# Data collections - dictionary - lists - tuple - indexing
# - print 3rd and 5th item from list - tuple - or dictionary
# - nested dict - list inside a dict
# - the list item from dict
# - which data type is mutable - immutable -

# food = ["choc", "crisp", "sweets", "drinks", "nuts"]
# print(food[0])
# print(food[4])
